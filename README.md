# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Alex**, a frontend engineer based in **Serbia**.

With **7+ years of experience** in frontend development, I love building fast, clean, and intuitive interfaces using **React**, **Next.js**, and modern web technologies. I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple and elegant user experiences.

Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me:  
- 🎮 playing PC games  
- 🎬 watching movies or binge-watching a good series  
- 🤖 exploring new AI tools and staying up to date with the latest tech trends  

I’m driven, curious, and I hate procrastination — if I start something, I finish it.  
Always learning. Always building.
